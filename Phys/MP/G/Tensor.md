# Tensor

![t](https://qph.cf2.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-5d56d790fbf3502f5dd97b53360235cb)


Naively, a [tensor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor) is a generalized collection of vector and covector using the [tensor product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_product). It is an element of a space built from vectors and covectors via tensor products (and linear combinations).

Mathematically, A $$(k,\ell)$$-tensor on a vector space $V$ is an element of $$V^{\otimes k}\otimes (V^*)^{\otimes \ell}$$ (equivalently a multilinear map $$(V^*)^k\times V^\ell\to\mathbb{F}$$) characterized by the universal property of the tensor product.


Physically, a tensor is something obeying physical law under the coordinate transformations.
Energy and mass for example are rank-0 tensor, which are called scalars. Force (usually in CM) is rank-1 tensor, which is called vector. To be clear, it is $$(1, 0)$$-tensor. Bivector is $$(2,0)$$-tensor. Conductivity, elasticity, piezoelastic effect, etc. are rank-2 tensor. Moment of Inertia, metric tensor, Ricci curvature, symplectic form are $$(0,2)$$-tensor.
