# Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Field Theory
![Map of QM](/assets/img/mapqm.png)

I would normally refer to some textbooks well-known when studying, *Introduction to Quantum Mechanics* by Griffiths, *Quantum Physics* by Gasiorowicz, *Quantum Mechanics* by Landau, *The Principle of Quantum Mechanics* by Dirac, *Modern Quantum Mechanics* by Sakurai and some lecture notes and other data from the Internet.

- [Approximation method] [PDF](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/aqm/topics2.pdf)
- [Topological Quantum Computing and Majorana Zero Mode]

There's couple of good lecture notes by David Tong(Thank you sir <3); Lecture notes on [QFT](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/qft.html), so check it out. Also QFT is known to be highly important in several fields especially theoretical Physics, not only HEP-TH but also including solid state physics and statistical physics. But presently I'm planning to major in condensed matter physics after attending graduate school, so I would just briefly study these topics.
