# Classical Mechanics and Relativity

![Map of CM](/assets/img/mapcm.png)

This category basically includes college and graduate level Classical Mechanics, theory of Relativity, and classical field theory. There are many references but I prefer *Classical mechanics* by Morin, same titie by Goldstein, *Mechanics* and *Classical Theory of Fields* by Landau, *Analytical Mechanics* by Fowles, *Classical Dynamics of Particles and Systems* by Marion, *Spacetime and Geometry* by Carroll,*Gravitation* by Misner, Thorne, Wheeler, *A First Course in General Relativity* by Schutz, and several lecture notes.
