# Physics

The Maps of Physics are noted items from *No-Nonsense Physics* series and *Teach Yourself Physics* by Schwichtenberg. These books are not for major because they deal with very brief basics of Physics, yet it's simply compact and useful. I refer to his diagrams for better understanding from the moment, but I will make them by myself later.
