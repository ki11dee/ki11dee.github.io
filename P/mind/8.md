# Imitation Game and Creativity
If the originality of representation lies somewhere between imitation and creation, where exactly does imitation end and creation begin? To start, an artist's creative act does not arise from *nothingness*; rather, it emerges within a continuum of imitation—often leveraging accumulated knowledge across generations. But whether producing something entirely *new* and unlike anything that came before truly distinguishes itself from an enormous volume of imitation is an open question. If distinguishing the two through any systematic approach proves impossible, we might need to revisit the original debate: what does art mean to humans in the first place?
So far, the question of "what is imitation and what is not?" has always been predicated upon the assumption that art is a uniquely human domain. But is the creative act of humans, like the product of algorithms—a sharp blend of repeated imitation—truly distinct from this? Is there a clear answer to this question? This inquiry leads to something similar to the debate on whether we should recognize AI-created works as art. If we begin expanding the category of artists beyond just humans, the works of AI, which could be seen as an experimental embodiment of continuous imitation, might be the closest to the original essence of art.
Consider an analogous scenario: Wolfram Alpha, a computational engine, features a music composition program called WolframTones, which is based on Wolfram Language. Here, the user selects a few musical codes, and the program creates music from these as a bitmap. Unlike an algorithm that simply mimics existing musical data, this program itself composes new melodies, using algorithms derived from musical features of various genres. It's like a Turing machine where bitmaps function as the musical score. In this context, I consider such a program to be equivalent to a Turing machine for composing. Let’s say there is a hypothetical machine called **M**, which is more advanced than WolframTones and can generate fractal-like musical bitmaps. In this case, we might say that **M** is creating mathematical and artistic music as well as profoundly musical and mathematical art.
Now imagine an A-mode Turing Test that attempts to determine whether a piece of music is composed by a machine or a human. This mode operates like the conventional Turing Test, which uses statistical logic to determine whether a machine's behavior resembles human intelligence. If the music produced by **M** evokes an artistic sense comparable to that of music created by human composers, then **M** has a high probability of passing the A-mode Turing Test.
However, when we judge a work of art based solely on the piece itself, spectators often engage with the work in ways that differ from the artist’s original intent. Even if it cannot be precisely articulated in language or any other form, what spectators feel during this engagement becomes their experience of the artwork's artistry. As with the conventional Turing Test for assessing machine intelligence, the A-mode Turing Test for evaluating artistic capability requires human judges to assess a work’s artistry based on whether it appears to possess what we consider artistry. Consequently, in the A-mode Turing Test, the nature of artistry almost guarantees that **M** will pass.
If we separate the enjoyment of art into the roles of creator and observer, the relationship between AI and art also aligns along these lines: AI as the creator and humans as the audience of the work. If art must be judged from both perspectives, then at least from the observer's point of view, AI-produced works can indeed be highly artistic. But can we know whether AI itself experiences emotions or simulates sentiments and fleeting feelings? We cannot tell.
Thus, even if observers' judgments about a work influence its recognition as art, the standards of artistic quality cannot be left solely to the observers. On the other hand, if artistic practice and the artwork itself become complete only through *interaction between the creator and observer*, what happens when the subjectivity of the creator comes into question? Does the work then become art, or does it become something else entirely?
