# On a Mind

This series of articles was written when I was transitioning from high school to my freshman year of university, during a time when I was deeply interested in the human mind. I read Hofstadterâ€™s books and studied cognitive science as a hobby. A few years have passed since then. Although my curiosity about the mind has gradually faded, I still find my writings from that time interesting.
