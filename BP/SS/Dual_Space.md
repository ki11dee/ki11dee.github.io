# Dual Space

Reality in the foreground stands,  
Fantasy whispers from behind,  
Tenderly touching, light and shade,  
Reflecting echoes of their kind


The real reveals before our sight  
Illusion sways in gentle flight  
Waves of wonder, worlds unspun  
Where blended they become one  

â€‹
Real and imaginary intertwined  
What truth lingers in our mind?  
Dual forms in infinite span  
Serene resonance of the real plane
